# SheepsTor
Utility for updating static websites manually or by responding to GitHub webhook events.

## Configuration
Sheepstor is configured from one config file (see `./config/config_SAMPLE.yaml` for annotated example).

The config file contains some references to ENV variables which must be set in the environment where Sheepstor is run.

Sheepstor currently support two possible content processors (set in the `content_processor` property in the config file):
- Hugo (invokes Hugo to compile the site)
- None (in which case it will just copy the sources verbatim)

## Debugging
Run any of the commands below with an additional flag `--debug`


## Run as web service to respond to GitHub webhook events
```bash
./sheepstor server --config=<CONFIG_FILE_PATH> --port <PORT_NUMBER>
```

## Run as command line utility to manually update site(s)
### Update single website

./sheepstor update --config=<CONFIG_FILE_PATH> --sites=<ID_OF_SITE_FROM_CONFIG>
